# LED Lamp

Inspired by [this project](http://www.eerkmans.nl/pacman-lamp-with-arduino/) a lamp

[![LED lamp](http://img.youtube.com/vi/5vNteZiAiWw/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vNteZiAiWw "LED Lamp")

## Notes:

The code was written with a 144 1meter LED strip. It might work on a longer strip but it's unlikely to work on a shorter strip.

Unlike the project linked above this one is powered by a USB charger with 2 sockets each able to deliver 2.4 amps. All 144 lamps
on full bright white would require ~6 amps so the code never turns on more than about half the lights and never at full bright white.

The LED strip is inside a [foam tube](https://www.google.com/search?q=foam+tube+white) to diffuse the light
